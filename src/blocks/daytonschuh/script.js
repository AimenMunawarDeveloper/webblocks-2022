    Base functionality:
        Make a call to pokeapi
        Get random pokemon
        Display blacked out image of pokemon
        Wait for user
        Get guess from user
        Check if guess is correct
        Unveil pokemon
*/

/*
    Future considerations:
        "Who's that pokemon?" audio cue / Background music
        Scoring (maybe based on time taken to guess)
